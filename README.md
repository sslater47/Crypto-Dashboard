# Crypto Dashboard

Simple dashboard showing cryptocurrency information with basic predictive
insights and a lightweight portfolio tracker. Prices are fetched from the
CoinGecko API and a naive algorithm estimates the next day's price to
provide a simple buy/sell/hold signal.

## Testing

Run the unit tests using:

```sh
npm test
```
